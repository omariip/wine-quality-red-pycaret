# Red Wine Quality Classification using PyCaret

## Abstract
This project discovers the application of supervised machine learning on the quality of red wines based different attributes. The project uses the Red Wine Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The quality score is numeric in the dataset but it was converted into three categorical classes, low, medium, and high, which makes the problem a multiclass classification. Using the PyCaret library, the flow was made automatic, including data preprocessing, model comparision using cross-validation, and selection of the best model. The model scored a perfect (1.0) accuracy and AUC scores in cross-validation, which shows an excellent fit to this dataset. Based on the results, variables such as alcohol content, sulphates, and volatile acidity were the strongest influencers on the predicted quality. While the results had very high accuracy, there should also be caution about over-fitting.
